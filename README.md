# Overview
This project is a web application developed to improve my skills and learn more about python. The web app is designed to facilitate document management and file storage with an intuitive user experience.

To start a test server on your local machine, run the following command in your project directory: python manage.py runserver

Then open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the app’s main page.

I wrote this software to explore the integration between Django (as a backend framework) and Supabase (for cloud-based storage and authentication), and to practice implementing robust, scalable web solutions. This project allowed me to experiment with file uploads, dynamic content rendering, user management, and modern cloud workflows.
